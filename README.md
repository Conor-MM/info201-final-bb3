# info201-final-bb3

This is the final project for INFO 201, group BB3.

## Project Description:

Our project will use data from the [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) API to map the frequency and intensity of earthquakes in given geographic regions.

While a wide variety of people could be interested in this data, we will present it in a way that the general public—specifically Americans with only a high school education—would be able to understand. We will do this by making the final product easy to navigate, using descriptive keys to present the data and including links to more information on earthquakes. We will also keep the site’s vocabulary simple and minimize text overall, making the earthquake map the most prominent feature.

Our final product will help viewers answer the following questions:
“What was the biggest recent earthquake in a specific US state?”
“What is the average magnitude of earthquakes in a geographic region?”
“How frequent are earthquakes happening in this region?”
